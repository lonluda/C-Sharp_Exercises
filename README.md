Asked to ChatGPT to create a plan for learning and improve C# coding skill.

⭐ 30-Day C# Learning Plan — Build Skills Through Daily Mini-Projects

This plan assumes you already know some basic C# (as shown by your console app with TryParse) and want to grow steadily until you can build more structured projects.

📅 Week 1 — Core Language Foundations

Goal: understand syntax, variables, input/output, operators.

1	Install IDE (VS / VS Code), understand project structure	"Hello World" console app  
2	Variables & data types (int, double, string, bool)	App that prints your name, age, height  
3	User input with Console.ReadLine()	Personalized greeting app  
4	Arithmetic operators	Simple calculator for two numbers (+ - * /)  
5	Conditionals (if/else)	Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero  
6	Logical operators (&&, ||, !)  
7	Week recap	"Guess the number" game (1–10)  

📅 Week 2 — Loops, Arrays, Lists  

Goal: learn repetition and data collections.

8	while loops	Print numbers 1 to 10  
9	for loops	Print the first 10 even numbers  
10	Arrays	Ask for 5 numbers, store them, compute sum  
11	Lists (List<int>)	Add numbers to a list and print them  
12	Loop + input	Find the maximum of numbers entered until user types "0"  
13	Nested loops	Print multiplication tables 1–5  
14	Week recap	Small menu: 1) Sum numbers, 2) Find max, 3) Exit  

📅 Week 3 — Functions, Classes, Error Handling

Goal: write reusable code, understand objects, handle invalid input.

15	Functions / methods	Function that sums two numbers  
16	App for calculate mathematical operations from CLI.

17	Functions + input	Ask user for numbers, call functions  
18	Intro to classes	Class Person with Name, Age, Greet()  
19	Constructors & properties	Class Rectangle with Width, Height, Area()  
20	Error handling (try/catch, TryParse)	Improved calculator that cannot crash  
21	Week recap	"Guess the number" rebuilt using classes and functions  

📅 Week 4 — Realistic, Combined Console Projects

Goal: create more complex apps using everything learned.

22	Lists + functions	Simple To-Do List (add/remove tasks)  
23	Classes + objects	Contact Manager (Contact with name, phone, email)  
24	Full menu + operations	Calculator with options: +, −, ×, ÷  
25	File I/O	Save To-Do list or contacts to .txt file  
26	Main menu system	User chooses between calculator, tasks, or contacts  
27	Combined project	Mini personal assistant console app  
28	Debugging & refactoring	Clean code, improve error handling  
29	Final project	Multi-menu console app with: Calculator + To-Do List + Contacts  
30	Review & polish	Add comments, improve output formatting, final testing
