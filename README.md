# C-Sharp_Exercises
Asked to ChatGPT to create a plan for learning and improve C# coding skill.

⭐ 30-Day C# Learning Plan — Build Skills Through Daily Mini-Projects

This plan assumes you already know some basic C# (as shown by your console app with TryParse) and want to grow steadily until you can build more structured projects.

📅 Week 1 — Core Language Foundations

Goal: understand syntax, variables, input/output, operators.

Day	Topic	Mini-Project
1	Install IDE (VS / VS Code), understand project structure	"Hello World" console app  
2	Variables & data types (int, double, string, bool)	App that prints your name, age, height
3	User input with Console.ReadLine()	Personalized greeting app
4	Arithmetic operators	Simple calculator for two numbers (+ - * /)
5	Conditionals (if/else)	Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
6	Logical operators (&&, `	
7	Week recap	"Guess the number" game (1–10)
📅 Week 2 — Loops, Arrays, Lists

Goal: learn repetition and data collections.

Day	Topic	Mini-Project
8	while loops	Print numbers 1 to 10
9	for loops	Print the first 10 even numbers
10	Arrays	Ask for 5 numbers, store them, compute sum
11	Lists (List<int>)	Add numbers to a list and print them
12	Loop + input	Find the maximum of numbers entered until user types "0"
13	Nested loops	Print multiplication tables 1–5
14	Week recap	Small menu: 1) Sum numbers, 2) Find max, 3) Exit
📅 Week 3 — Functions, Classes, Error Handling

Goal: write reusable code, understand objects, handle invalid input.

Day	Topic	Mini-Project
15	Functions / methods	Function that sums two numbers
16	Functions with return values	Function that computes rectangle area
17	Functions + input	Ask user for numbers, call functions
18	Intro to classes	Class Person with Name, Age, Greet()
19	Constructors & properties	Class Rectangle with Width, Height, Area()
20	Error handling (try/catch, TryParse)	Improved calculator that cannot crash
21	Week recap	"Guess the number" rebuilt using classes and functions
📅 Week 4 — Realistic, Combined Console Projects

Goal: create more complex apps using everything learned.

Day	Topic	Mini-Project
22	Lists + functions	Simple To-Do List (add/remove tasks)
23	Classes + objects	Contact Manager (Contact with name, phone, email)
24	Full menu + operations	Calculator with options: +, −, ×, ÷
25	File I/O	Save To-Do list or contacts to .txt file
26	Main menu system	User chooses between calculator, tasks, or contacts
27	Combined project	Mini personal assistant console app
28	Debugging & refactoring	Clean code, improve error handling
29	Final project	Multi-menu console app with: Calculator + To-Do List + Contacts
30	Review & polish	Add comments, improve output formatting, final testing
